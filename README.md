# CL469_Spr2025

This is the collections of all my scripts and simulations for the course CL469 - Lattice Boltzmann Method for Fluid Flows. 
- Instructor : Amol Subhedar 
- Type : Dept. Elective 
- Semester Taken : VI (Jan 2025 - April 2025) 
- Difficulty : TBD 
- Grading : TBD

## Prequisites 
- Mathematical simulations
- Implicit solutions
- Fluid Dynamics ( Taken by Prof. Amol only in chem eng. IITB )
- Navier Stokes ( This is basically the holy grail of all fluid courses) 
- Computational Methods Lab (helpful for writing scripts and all ) 
- Some Visualization Techniques ( Optional )
- Python (my prefrence)

## Pythonic Libs 
- Numpy ()
- matplotlib
- Some Animation based lib for vids ( TBD )

## Logistics 
- Midsem : 25%
- Final Project : 35%
- Assignments (2/3) : 20%
- Announced Quizzes (2) : 20% (10% each)
- No Attendance policy ( No DX grades Yayyy!)
- Room 121 Chem. Eng. Ground Floor | Slot 6: 1100 - 1230 hrs  ( Wed | Fri )
- Basic course -> Adv version supposed to be running in the next odd semester (TBD)

## Project Idea 
2D/3D based rendering engine (maybe as a plugin to blender?????) for doing large scale simulations on low compute hardware. 

## Final Verdict 
TBD
